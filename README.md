Welcome to the file of progress for the Machine Learning Project of Data Science and Machine Learning course of the University of Lausanne. Our Machine Learning problem is about assesing sentence difficulty.

We have a dataset with some senteces in french and their difficulties levels. We have to train this model to create our own model in aim to predict the most accurate possible an other dataset with other sentences. 
To find the most accurate models we have to try differents models and parameters to find the best one. 

We will write our evolution in a table of progress where will speak about the of the group, the differents models that we test and the differents parameters. Furthermore we'll do an interactive interface to show our results with streamlit, and present a video with our results during the last session of this course in december.
