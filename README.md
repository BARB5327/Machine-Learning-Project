# Machine-Learning-Project
Machine Learning Project 2023
## Presentation of the projetct
Welcome to the file of progress for the Machine Learning Project of Data Science and Machine Learning course of the University of Lausanne. Our Machine Learning problem is about assesing sentence difficulty.The team of this repository is composed of Alessandro BARBIERI and Taylan SAHIN.

We have a dataset with some senteces in french and their difficulties levels. We have to train this model to create our own model in aim to predict the most accurate possible an other dataset with other sentences. 
To find the most accurate models we have to try differents models and parameters to find the best one. There is a ranking for this profect with all the members and you can find the evolution of this competition and support us.  https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/detecting-french-texts-difficulty-level-2023/overview

##Structure of the GITHUB
We will write our evolution in a table of progress where will speak about the of the group, the differents models that we test and the differents parameters. Furthermore we'll do an interactive interface to show our results with streamlit, and present a video with our results available on this link : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfMngmtuoGc
You can find our models in the models section of the project. If you want to find the documentation that help us for this project, you have to go on the documentation section. Unfortunately our Streamlit app is not available in the project because the streamlit folder is too heavy. If you want to discover the code of this app, send me an email at :alessandro.barbieri@unil.ch and we will share you the streamlit app.

However you can see how the app work in our youtube presentation.
